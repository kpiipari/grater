*Grater*

Grater is a recipe scraper command line application that scrapes recipes from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/).

When you run Grater, it gives you a list of 12 recipe categories to choose from. Based on a category (e.g. "healthy) you select, it lists the recipe collections available for that category. By selecting a collection, Grater returns a numbered list of recipe titles to choose from. When you select a recipe, Grater lists the ingredient list and step by step method to cook the chosen recipe.

User selection is done by inputting a list item number. 

**Example**
- To select a recipe from `healthy` category, enter `1`
- To select the `Cheap and healthy` recipe collection, which belongs to `healthy` category, enter `5`
- To get the ingredient list and cooking instructions for the `Winter vegetable pie` recipe, enter `25`
