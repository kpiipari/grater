#Grater

Grater is a recipe scraper command line application that scrapes recipes from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/).

When you run Grater, it gives you a list of 12 recipe categories to choose from. Based on a category (e.g. "healthy) you select, it lists the recipe collections available for that category. By selecting a collection, Grater returns a numbered list of recipe titles to choose from. When you select a recipe, Grater lists the ingredient list and step by step method to cook the chosen recipe.
